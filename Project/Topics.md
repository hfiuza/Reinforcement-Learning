__Description__: after the many progresses of reinforcement learning these last years, one may wonder whether we can learn, efficiently, to solve a combinatorial optimization problem by reinforcement learning. This is exactly the topic of this project: reviewing state of the art reinforcement learning approaches, the goal is to investigate how to model a combinatorial optimization problem and have it solved efficiently by RL. Candidate problems are
TSP, Knapsack, graph coloring, ...
